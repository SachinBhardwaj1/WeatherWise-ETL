# WeatherWise-ETL

WeatherWise-ETL is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to automate the processing of weather data. This project demonstrates how to fetch raw weather datasets, apply data transformations, and store the results for further analysis. The modular structure supports extensibility for different data sources and transformation logic.

Further enhancement includes - leverage the CSV as data source, and plot charts for visualizations using POWER BI.

## What We Learned

- **ETL Concepts:** Implemented the full ETL cycleâ€”extracting data from Openmeteo APIs, transforming it for consistency and usability, and loading it into a CSV file.
- **Data Engineering:** Explored best practices for organizing code, handling data pipelines, and ensuring data quality.
- **Python Programming:** Used Python for scripting, modularization, and leveraging libraries for data manipulation.
- **API Integration:** Learned how to interact with external APIs to fetch real-time weather data.
- **Data Transformation:** Applied cleaning, normalization, and enrichment techniques to raw datasets.
- **Project Structure:** Practiced organizing a scalable codebase for collaborative development.
- **GitHub Collaboration:** How to collaborate with other engineer using GitHub
- **POWER BI:** Learned how to use POWER BI and plot charts for visualization
